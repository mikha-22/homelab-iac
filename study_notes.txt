Terraform modules are divided per folders, with one state-file.

Terraform init loads the plugins/providers defined in the terraform.tf, configures the backend and the state file target,
remote or local and creates a .terraform folder in the directory, (just like git init)

While it is possible to create a single main.tf which contains everything, from terraform and provider config, variables,
outputs, it's best practice to split them up.

terraform.tf contains configuration for terraform, typically the version, the required providers to be installed, and
its version, also the backend statefile target (local or remote)

main.tf contains the main module logic, some data definition and loading, and the resource provisioning logic

outputs.tf contains the output to be displayed after an execution (apply, destroy, etc) and also will be saved
as an object in the statefile

variables.tf contains the declaration of variables and typically its default values

terraform.tfvars contains the actual values of the variables (typically environment specific, can have secrets, do not commit
to git)

providers.tf contains the configuration specific for certain providers.
